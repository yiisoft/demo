## Installation

You'll need at least PHP 8.1.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `composer install` in your project root directory.
3. Run `./yii serve` (on Windows `yii serve`). The application will be started on http://localhost:8080/.
4. Go to the index page. Cycle ORM will create tables, indexes and relations automatically in the configured DB for you.
   If you want to disable this behavior then comment out the line with the `Generator\SyncTables::class` in the `config/packges/yiisoft/yii-cycle/params.php`.
   In this case you should create migrations to sync changes that you have made to entities with the DB.
5. Run `./yii fixture/add 20` to create some random data.

## Console

Console works out of the box and could be executed with `./yii`.

Some commands:

```bash
user/create <login> <password>
fixture/add [count]
```

In order to register your own commands, add them to `console/params.php`, `console` â†’ `commands` section.

## Web application

In order to run the web application, you can either use the built-in web server by running `./yii serve` or you could use a
real web server by pointing it to `/public/index.php`.

More routes could be added by editing `src/Factory/AppRouterFactory`.

## Testing

The template comes with a  ready to use [Codeception](https://codeception.com/) configuration.
In order to execute tests run the following command:

```
composer run serve 127.0.0.1:8080 > ./runtime/yii.log 2>&1 &
vendor/bin/codecept run
```

### Static analysis

The code is statically analyzed with [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/). To run static analysis:

```shell
./vendor/bin/psalm
```
